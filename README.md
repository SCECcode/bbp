## Description 
The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform (BBP) is a software system that can generate 0-20+ Hz seismograms for historical and scenario earthquakes in California, Eastern North America, and Japan using several alternative computational methods.

## Support
Support for BBP is provided by that Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Research Computing Group. This group supports several research software distributions including UCVM. Users can report issues and feature requests using UCVM's github-based issue tracking link below. Developers will also respond to emails sent to the SCEC software contact listed below.

## Citation
References, citations, and acknowledgements help us obtain continued support for the development of the BBP software. If you use the BBP software in your research, please include the citation of the UCVM paper in the references/bibliography section of your publication. This is more effective than you providing in-text acknowledgements.

* Example Acknowlegement: We would like to acknowledge the use of the SCEC Unified Community Velocity Model Software (Small 2017) in this research. 

Along with citing the BBP software, researchers should also cite the appropriate publication for any of the ground motion models they use in their research. Citations for individual velocity models are included in the [Credits](CREDITS.md) file in this repository, and in the GitHub repository that has been created for each model.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to the BBP software framework. 
Geoscientists can register their ground motion models into BBP and software developers can 
improve and extend the BBP software. An overview of the process for contributing seismic models or 
software updates to the BBP Project is provided in the BBP [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). 
BBP contributors agree to abide by the code of conduct found in our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guidelines.

## Credits
Development of BBP is a group effort. A list of developers that have contributed to the BBP Software framework 
are listed in the [Credits.md](CREDITS.md) file in this repository.
